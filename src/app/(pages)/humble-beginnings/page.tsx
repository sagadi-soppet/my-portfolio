        What made you come here at the bottom of the barrels, my humble

        Yes, I know the site is ugly, so what! I&apos;ve never learned css. For
        me design is crap! Not saying that it is crap! It&apos;s the face of
        everything, without frontend, we backend devs would remain at where we
        are, THE BACK!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It&apos;s just that I don&apos;t have a nack for it, and I mind you that
        I tried my hardest to learn css, and when I say tried my hardest. I
        built my foundation from the very bottom. Learning HTML tags, to making
        a bare bones site without the css. Then styling it to my hearts content.
        Created some rainbow shit and star and finally bam! My first site was
        done.

        No I don&apos;t have a copy of that abomination. I was still in college
        at that time and I worked it on a borrowed computer at a computer lab.
        And you know what, good for you. Coz you won&apos;t be able to see that
        monstrosity.

      <p>
        Now I work at a company that has a really good Creative Content, and
        I&apos;m really good. Then we the backend just mess that design up like
        we just wanted it to be Taco Tuesday, everyday, it is a hell of a mess.
        You could say functionality-wise the app works but design-wise.
        &quot;Why does the app not have any relative look to the passed Figma
        design?&quot; &quot;Did the client say something?&quot; &quot;No?&quot;
        &quot;Then who cares&quot;

        Wow! I&apos;ve been rambling on, huh? Well since you&apos;ve read this I
        recommend you read the next once. I&apos;ll make sure to share my
        experiences and my pitfalls.
