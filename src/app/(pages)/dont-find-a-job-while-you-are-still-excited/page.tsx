      <p>The title says it all, and I beg you don&apos;t do it.</p>

        If your heart is still palpitating from the excitement of finally
        graduating and now you are in front of a recruiter and they only need
        your, &quot;Yes, I&apos;ll be your slave&quot;.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Don&apos;t say, yes. I&apos;ll repeat it so it hits home. DO NOT SAY
        YES!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You are not being proposed to that you&apos;d feel giddy and dizzy. You
        are applying for a job that might or might not be the one you will work
        at forever. Think things through. Double take, look at the recruiter in
        the eye and ask them to say it again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If they flinch, don&apos;t apply for that company, there is some shady
        stuff happening in there and you don&apos;t wanna be part of it
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        (Disclaimer: Not a psychologist so don&apos;t take it at face value but
        before the flinching part, it&apos;s based on experience).

      <p>9/10 times that job is not for you. Go home, sit down take a breather. Have a week or a month to yourself, or even a year. Just explain to your parents that you are still settling down the graduation fever or even explain it to yourself. Just don&apos;t take too long. Oh, yeah keep studying during those times, whatever your profession is, don&apos;t let yourself get rusty.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Once you&apos;ve calmed down. Ask yourself what you want to be in 10 years, and mean it. Don&apos;t just think for the sake of thinking. Make a thorough plan. Plan it all out. Just whatever the heck you want. Do you wanna be a veteran in your profession or do you want something else? Think things through.</p>
      <br />
      <p>And once you are done with all the planning take the first step, get out of the shitty whole you are and start looking for a job, or just start doing!</p>
      <br />
      <p>Once you are earning save up for the first thing you&apos;ve planned up. Make it the reward for finally opening your cocoon and finally, Garsh darn it, what was it that comes out of a cocoon?</p>
      <br />
      <p>...</p>
      <br />
      <p>A yes. A Butterfly. Be the butterfly you are meant to be, fly! But yes avoid the birds and the spiders. Just keep flying you colorful insect you are.</p>
